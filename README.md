Artyom Schukin portfolio site

My portfolio website, still actively working on it.
Was using Jquery to make transition animation on website.
Background canvas animation was taken from Vanta js. 


Right now focusing on making website design adaptive, know about issues like not scaling canvas on hi-dpi displays.
